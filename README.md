# Crypto Arbitrage App

This application tracks the arbitrage spreads between Bitstamp (that has historically lower closing prices) and (Coinbase that has historically higher closing prices).
Using the existing data set in the csv files for bitstamp and coinbase, we are able to identify trends and patterns between the pricing data between these two cryptocurrencies and in the end will be able to identify where arbitrage opportunities were if any in the year of 2018.
